# quaketools

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This package was initially created by Zak Varty (quaketools/zakvarty) with 
function for the GPD distribution, this is a forked repository where 
we have extended the package functionality.

The goal of quaketools is to provide a collection of tools to make
earthquake modelling easier. Functions will be provided to simulate
from, estimate and evaluate common models used in statistical
seismology.

## Installation

You can install the development version of quaketools from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("paulaoak/quaketools")
```

## Example from quaketools/zakvarty

This is a basic example which shows you how to simulate random variates
from a generalised Pareto distribution using `rgpd()`.

``` r
library(quaketools)
set.seed(4321)
rgpd(n = 10, scale = 1, shape = 0, shift = 0)
#>  [1] 1.09428759 0.09525675 0.88787411 3.12718659 0.26984201 0.28709705
#>  [7] 0.22320500 0.12244318 0.80088136 0.71840360
```

While this is equivalent to using `rexp()`, the seeding is not handled
in the same way. In the following example we get two distinct samples
from the standard exponential distribution.

``` r
set.seed(1234)
rgpd_sample <- rgpd(n = 500, scale = 1, shape = 0, shift = 0)

set.seed(1234)
rexp_sample <- rexp(n = 500, rate = 1)


qqplot(
  x = rexp_sample,
  y = rgpd_sample, 
  xlim = c(0,8),
  ylim = c(0,8), 
  pch = 16,
  col = rgb(0,0,0,0.3))
abline(a = 0, b = 1, col = "darkorange")
```
